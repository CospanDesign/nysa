GPIO Control:

Control GPIO by setting individual signals at input or output

To read signals, set either Polling/Interrupt

Polling: read all the GPIOs after the specified timeout, update
   all data
Interrupt: read all the GPIOs if a specific condition is met
  Use the 'Interrupt Enable' and 'Interrupt Edge' to specify
  the condition in which to read the data

  Note:
    Interrupts are less processor intesive but due to
    Limitations of certain platforms (eg USB) true interrrupts
    are not truly possible and polling is just as effective as
    interrupts for those platforms.
